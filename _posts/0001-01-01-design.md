# Healthcare.gov Design

<div class="intro">
The overall design direction for HealthCare.gov can be summed up in one word – TRUST. We invite site visitors to trust us from the moment they see the first screen until the moment they leave the site from an interior page. This underlying principle determines the look, feel, voice, and overall brand for the site.

## Consumer Experience

In order to promote a positive user experience, we maintain ease of use throughout the site. All content must be clear, concise, and easily accessible. Likewise site visitors are guided through clutter-fee and simplified processes when using Marketplace applications and tools.
