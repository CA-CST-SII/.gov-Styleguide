# Identity

In keeping with our theme of TRUST, the Healthcare.gov logo, establishes a universal signature across all Healthcare.gov communications. We treat the logo the same across all mediums. See the rules to follow when using the Healthcare.gov logo below.

## Logo

To ensure that our logo is clearly discernable, it requires space as shown below, free of type, graphics, and other elements that might cause visual clutter. There is also a Spanish version of the logo. Download both versions.

## Usage

The Healthcare.gov logo should only ever be used against a white background. Do not place the logo against any other background color or modify it in any way.
