Developer Site - Design Micro-Site
#Executive Summary
HealthCare.gov is supported by numerous development teams each owning a piece of the entire consumer flow.  Despite every best effort this has led to a disjointed and sometimes confusing user experience.

By creating a single place where developers and designers can come to understand, collaborate and consume a standardized repository of UI components, UX patterns and developer assets we can greatly improve the consistency and quality of the consumer experience.
